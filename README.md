# COURSE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

### Project Description
---
##### Objective
The project aims to develop an application using Python to recommend courses to students based on the course ratings and availability to help them with the registration process with minimal effort required. The application streamlines the process so that students can select the best available courses based on their interests. The app requests some basic information like- enrolled degree program from the user.

##### TechStack Used
Python IDLE (python 3.7), Web Scraping Tool (Beautiful Soup) 

##### Future Work
There are still a lot of features like- building an optimal semester schedule for students based on the recommended course they take, that we hope to implement in the future.

### Model Description
---
The model used for generating the top courses based on the similarity score is. The model takes those features and compares the cosine pairwise similarity with other similar courses for the program. Finally, the model outputs an ordered list of top N recommendations.

### Dataset Used
---
We have merged 3 different datasets to generate a final combined dataset which consists of 100000 instances and 14 features like- hours per week, overall course rate, course availability, etc. The following 3 datasets have been generated by performing web scraping on the online data available at CMUâ€™s official website and have been cleaned to get the highest quality information.

1)	[List of courses offered by CMU](https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/assets/SOC/sched_layout_spring.htm)
2)	[MISM Student Handbook](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/heinz-shared/_files/img/student-handbooks/mism-2019-2020-student-handbook.pdf)
3)	[Course Evaluation Results](https://www.smartevals.com/Reporting/Students/Results.aspx?Type=Sections&y=2021&Wizard=True&FiveYearsOnly=True) 

### Installation
---
For the program to run in IDLE, you need to install the following modules using the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) 
- matplotlib, bs4, openpyxl, pathlib, lxml

##### INSTALLATION STEPS
1) Open the command prompt window and change the directory to the **Scripts** folder in the python source folder.  
Example: **cd C:\Users\tt\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\Scripts**

2) Use pip3 install to install the required modules one by one. 
```bash
pip3 install [module_name]
```
**Note**: Some of the modules may have been already installed on your system.

After the installation, you can run the program in IDLE. Make sure all the files in the zip file are located in one directory which you remember. 

### How to RUN the App
---
Follow the instruction to run the app on your local system:
- First, open **IDLE**, then click **File - Open** to find the directory where you stored all the files, then choose `UI.py` and click **Open**.
